## Overview ##

&amp;nbsp;

1. How does being open to world economy affect a country's economic growth?

2. What are the particular channels through which openness affects growth?

3. Why are some people opposed to openness?




---

## Autarky versus Openness ##

*  **Autarky**: a country does not interact economically at all with the rest of the world
*  Openness

 *  the exchange of final goods and services
 
 *  flow of factors of production across borders

*  Measuring openness

 *  Quantities of goods and factors flow across borders
 
 *  **Law of one price:** if two countries trade freely with each other, the same good will sell for the same price in both markets

## Growth of world trade ##

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


*  1st wave of globalization: mid 1800s - 1914 

*  retreat from global integration: 1914 - 1950 

*  2nd wave of globalization: 1950 -

---
## Globalization: the causes ##



*  Decline in transport costs

*  Increase in the ease of transmission of information (decline in the cost as well)

 *  simplified the coordination of economic activity
 *  allowed new types of trade (in services)

*  Trade policy

 *  Reductions in trade restrictions (GATT, WTO)

 *  Average tariffs in the industrial countries: 40% at the end of WW2, 6% by 2000

 *  In 2010, average tariff was 2.8% among OECD countries

 *  8.2% among middle-income countries

 *  11% among low-income countries

 *  Among industrialized countries, the highest tariff is on aggriculture

## Openness and GDP per Capita ##
&amp;nbsp;


*  Measure of openness: level of tariffs, manipulation of exchange rate, and government monopoly on export

*  For each year from 1965-2000: 1 if open, 0 if not

*  Always open countries are 4.5 times as rich as never open countries

*  Countries open more than half the time are 1.5 times as rich as countries that are open less than half the time

]

Graphics from: Weil (2013)

*  Closed economies (left graph): closed for some or all the years with the available data
*  Open economies (right graph): open entire period
*  Average growth: 1.5% in the closed group, 3.1% in the open group
*  Negative relationship between initial GDP and growth in the open economies


---
## How Changes in Openness Affect Growth ##

*  Trade liberalization led to rapid growth in

 *  Japan (1858) 65% increase in growth over two decades
 
 *  South Korea (1964-1965), income doubled in 11 years
 
 *  Uganda and Vietnam (1990s)

*  Trade embargo in the US (1807-1809, Jefferson) led to unemployment and bankruptcies


---

## Causal evidence ##
### Use geographical barriers as instruments ###

*  Geography: an exogenous factor that affects openness to trade
*  Frankel and Romer (1999)

 *  Geographical factors affect trade
 *  How does geographically determined trade volume affect income per capita?
 *  Raising the ratio of trade to GDP by one percentage point would raise income by .5%-2%

*  Feyrer (2009a, 2009b)

 *  Natural experiment: Closing of the Suez Canal (Egypt - Israel fight, 1967--1975)
 *  Significant reduction in trade volumes for countries that trading distance increased as a result
 *  Air freight led to increase in trade volume
 *  Led to increase in income (if trade cost decreased)



---

## Openness and Growth ##

&amp;nbsp;

What are the particular channels by which being open to the outside world affect's a country's level of income per capita?

*  through factor accumulation

*  through productivity

---

## Growth with Capital Mobility 

Physical capital flows across national borders through

*  foreign direct investment ($248M of $659M private capital flows into developing countries, 2010)

*  portfolio investment

*  government grants

*  lending from banks and multinational agencies like World Bank


---

## Solow Model in the Small Open Economy ##

*  An economy fully open to capital flows

 *  Investment can be financed by foreign savings
 *  Domestic savings can finance foreign investment

*  Law of one price holds: $$ r=r_w$$`
*  Output per worker
$$ y = Ak^\alpha h^{1-\alpha}$$
*  rental rate of capital
$$r_w = r = \text{MPK} = \alpha A k^{\alpha-1}h^{1-\alpha} $$
*  capital per worker
$$ k = \left(\frac{\alpha A}{r_w} \right)^{1/(1-\alpha)} h$$ 



---

## Solow Model, cont'd ##

*  Output per worker
$$y = Ak^\alpha = A \left(\left(\frac{\alpha A}{r_w} \right)^{1/(1-\alpha)} h \right)^\alpha h^{1-\alpha} = A^{1/(1-\alpha)} \left(\frac{\alpha}{r_w} \right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}h $$
*  **Implication \#1:** Output per worker does not depend on saving rate as opposed to output per worker in the closed economy:

$$ y^{ss} = A^{1/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{\gamma}{n+\delta} \right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)} h$$

*  GDP per worker will **not** be higher in the higher saving rate country

*  GNP per worker will be higher in the higher saving rate country



---

## GNP vs Saving Rate ##

*  Closed economy: `\(\uparrow\)` saving rate `\(\Rightarrow\)` `\(\uparrow\)` investment rate `\(\Rightarrow\)` `\(\uparrow\)` capital stock `\(\Rightarrow\)` `\(\uparrow\)` GDP
*  Open economy:  `\(\uparrow\)` saving rate

 *  Increase in capital stock would lower the marginal product of capital
 
 *  transfer capital abroad (higher return)
 
 *  until marginal product of capital equals world level
 
 *  capital stock per worker returns to its original level
 
 *  GDP stays the same
 
 *  GNP goes up



---

## Solow Model, cont'd ## 

*  ** Implication \#2:**  Opening to free capital flow raises GDP of low saving rate country

*  A country with low level of capital ( after war or a natural disaster) would benefit from opening to free capital flow

*  ** Implication \#3:** Opening to free capital flow decreases GDP of high saving rate country

*  GNP in both low and high saving countries will be higher after openness to trade



---
## Feldstein-Horioka Puzzle ##

*  saving and investment rates should be uncorrelated in the open economy

*  savings retention coefficient: fraction of additional saving ending up as additional domestic investment

 *  0.89 for the period 1960-1974
 
 *  0.60 for the period 1990-1997

*  Presumption of free capital movement is inappropriate

## Lucas Paradox ##

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

*  capital should flow from capital rich countries to capital scarce countries

*  major capital flow from China to the US


---

## Openness and Productivity ##

Gains from trade

*  comparative advantage: improvement in resource allocation 

 *  Natural endowments: tropical fruit in Guatemala
 
 *  Abundance of factors of production well suited to production of a good: the polishing of small diamonds in India
 
 *  It has already specialized in it (movies in the US)

*  increasing returns to scale leads to gains from specialization even without comparative advantage
*  Tariff reduction agreements under the Uruguay Round (1986--1994) raised world purchasing power by $73B per year (.2% of world GDP) [Brown, Deardorf and Stern (2002)]




---

## Openness and Productivity, cont'd ##

Competition

*  exposure to global competition forces improvement in efficiency 
 * Pavcnik (2002):
 * Trade liberalization in Chile in 1970s and 1980s
 * Plant productivity in import-competeting manufacturing sectors increased
 * Bloom, Draca, Van Reenen (2016):
  * Study European countries, 1996 - 2007:
  * Chinese import competition led to increased technical change within firms 
  * reallocated employment between firms towards more technologically advanced firms.
  
*  weakens monopolies who lead to resource misallocation
 *  in 1965: imports account for 6% of the U.S. car market
 *  in 1980: 27% (75% of which was from Japan
 *  Led to increase in quality of American cars
 *  After completion the US - Canada trade agreement, productivity in previously protected industries rose 3 times as unprotected industries

&lt;/center/&gt;

Graphic from: Weil (2013)

---
## Openness and Productivity, cont'd  ##

Technology transfer

 *  foreign direct investment: factories, management
 
 *  importing embodied technology: key inputs, capital goods
 
 *  importing ideas generated abroad
 
 *  interaction among countries: innovative organizational techniques


Incentive to R&amp;D

 *  larger market and profit opportunity



---
## Opposition to Openness ##

*  Workers and firms that have comparative disadvantage

 *  Reallocation of factors of production to different sectors / geographies are costly
 
 *  Adjustment takes long time
 
 *  Gains accrue to large number of people, each gains a small share
 
 *  Losses accrue to small number of people, each shoulder a high burden

*  Firms losing monopoly power

*  Owners of factor of production (openness leads to lower returns if capital was scarce before openness)

*  Higher return to low educated people without trade
