### Motivation


.pull-left[
- How does interaction with elite peers affect performance?

 - Referred as "spillover effects" or "peer effects"

 - Analyzed in many settings: sports, classrooms, innovators, ...

- Estimating spillover effects is difficult because of

 - non-random selection into treatment

 - agents respond to other incentives

- We analyze spillovers by

 - using Europan football as labaratory 

 - by relying on a quasi-experimental design

### Research Question:

<br>


<p style="font-size:30px;"> How much does interaction with elite peers affect performance? </p>

--
.left[<p style="font-size:20px;"> More specifically: </p>]

<p style="font-size:30px;"> How much does playing in UEFA Champions League affect team performance in domestic leagues? </p>



---
### Empirical Strategy
<br>


- Each season a few teams are eligible to play in the UEFA Champions League (UCL)

- This leads to a discontinuity in exposure to elite peers

- We exploit this discontinuity to analyze spillover effects

--

- The *causal effect of UCL* is about

 - +10 pecentage points increase in probability of winning a game

 - +0.3 goal difference per game on average

### Data Description

<br>


- A new data set of European football at the game level, including actual result, location, betting market odds, end of league tables, transfer fees.
<br>  

- *Top Five* European countries: England, Germany, Italy, Spain, and France
<br>

- Information on the universe of football games for the period 2000-2020
<br>

- We pool data across countries and seasons into a single sample
<br>

---
### Measures of Performance

<br>

<br>

- At the match level:

 - Goal difference (Ex-Post): the number of goals scored minus the number of goals conceded

 - Probality margin (Ex-ante): betting market determined probility of winning minus the probability of losing


- We conduct analysis using both measures

 - Focus on the probability margin in this presentation


---
 
### *(Ex-Ante)* Measure of Performance: [Probability Margin](#pm-detail)

- We use kick-off odds on football matches from 13 major online bookmakers: Bet365, BWin, ...


- From the odds, we calculate *ex-ante* probability of different events

- Probability margin of winning (PM), defined as probability of winning minus probability of loosing

#### Example

|	Date | 	Home Team |	Away Team |	B365 Away |	B365 Draw| 	B365 Home  |	Score |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|06/05/18 	|Barcelona |	Real Madrid |	4.50 |	4.33 |	1.66 |	2-2|


**Probabilities**

| Barcelona winning | Real Madrid Winning | Draw |
|:---:              | :---:               | :---: |
| 57%             | 21%               | 22% |

**Probability margin**

- $PM_{Bar,Mad,H,ESP,2018} = 57-21=36\%, \quad \quad$ $PM_{Mad,Bar,A,ESP,2018} = 21-57=-36\%$

### UEFA Champions League 

.pull-left[

- UCL is an annual club football competition organized by UEFA

- UCL is the most prestigious club competition in European football, contested by 32 clubs 

- Players are exposed to better quality peers in UCL

- The clubs that played in the 2018/19 UCL have shared about &euro;2 bn in payments from UEFA

- Plus matchday revenues, sponsorship deals, bargaining power in the transfer market, etc

### UCL Qualification



- Consider a national league with $N$ teams in season $t$


- Each team plays two matches against each opponent


- Outcome of each match is decided based on goal difference (GD)


- A positive GD indicates win (3 points), zero draw (1 point), and negative loss (0 point)


- Position is based on the total number of points at the end of season 

- Each league has a UEFA allocated quota for UCL

### Eligibility vs Participation


.pull-left[
- The eligibility is a deterministic function of the number of points
\begin{equation*}
\text{Elig}_{i,l,t} = 1(\text{Pts}_{i,l,t} \geq \text{Pts}^*_{l,t}),
\end{equation*}
where $(\text{Pts}^*_{l,t})$ is the **country-season specific threshold**, defined as average points of the best ineligible team and worst eligible team


- Eligibility does not gurantee playing in the UCL

 - Some teams need to play qualifying games
 
- Non-eligible teams can still play in the UCL

 - For example, by winning Europa League
 
- Hence, fuzzy regression discontinuity design

]



---

### Empirical Strategy
<br>

- Estimate model parameters using fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD)

- We estimate variants of the following regression model
\begin{equation*}
Y_{i,j,h,l,t+1} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \text{UCL}_{i,l,t} + f(S_{i,l,t}) + \nu_{i,l,t+1},
\end{equation*}
where $S_{i,l,t} \equiv \frac{Pts_{i,l,t}-Pts^*_{l,t}}{Std(Pts_{i,l,t})}$ is the centered points


 - $\text{Elig}_{i,l,t}$ is an instrument for $\text{UCL}_{i,l,t}$


 - We assume that $f(.)$ can be described by low-order polynomial

### Mechanisms through which UCL affects performance


- Money and prestige

 - Hire better managers
 
 - Hire better players
 
- Spillover effects

 - Players takes training sessions more seriously to be able to compete in UCL
 
 - Translates into physical fitness and tactical discipline 
 
 - Helps in domestic games
 
 - Learning from elite players

- We rule out the former, and argue for the latter channel

 - Run the same results with teams that did not change their managers in the previous summer
 
 - Look at the transfer fees of incoming and outgoing players

### Conclusion
<br>
<br>

- Playing in the UCL improves subsequent performance by 10 percentage points in prob. margin of winning a game and 0.3 goals 


- The improvement is large, statistically significant, and robust across different specifications


- By ruling out the money channel, we argue that spillover effects is the main channel.

 - Players take their training sessions more seriously and gain physical fitness and tactical discipline
 
 - Learning from other elite players

### Step 1: Odds to Probability

|	Date | 	Home Team |	Away Team |	B365 Away |	B365 Draw| 	B365 Home  |	Score |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|06/05/18 	|Barcelona |	Real Madrid |	4.50 |	4.33 |	1.66 |	2-2|

<br>

\begin{equation*}
\text{Implied probability} = \frac{1}{\text{Decimal odds}} \times 100
\end{equation*}

<br> 


\begin{gather*}
p_h = \frac{1}{o_h} \times 100 = \frac{1}{1.66} \times 100 = 60.2\%\\
p_d = \frac{1}{o_d} \times 100 = \frac{1}{4.33} \times 100 = 23.1\%\\
p_a = \frac{1}{o_a} \times 100 =  \frac{1}{4.50} \times 100 =22.2\%
\end{gather*}


---
### Step 2: Fair Probability

<br>

.pull-left[
- Normalize probabilities:

 - $p^*_h = \frac{p_h}{p_h+p_d+p_a}$
 
 - $p^*_d = \frac{p_d}{p_h+p_d+p_a}$
 
 - $p^*_a = \frac{p_a}{p_h+p_d+p_a}$
  ]


.pull-right[
- In our example
 - $p^*_h = \frac{60.2}{105.6}= 57\%,\; (p_h = 60.2\%)$
 
 - $p^*_d = \frac{23.1}{105.6}=21.9\%,\; (p_d = 23.1\%)$
 
 - $p^*_a = \frac{22.2}{105.6}=21\%,\; (p_a = 22.2\%)$
]
 

---
### Step 3: [Probability Margin](#uefa)

- The difference between team $i$ winning probability and team $j$ winning probaility
\begin{equation*}
PM_{i,j,l,c,t} = p^*_{i,l,c,t}- p^*_{j,l,c,t}, \; \text{ for all } i \neq j
\end{equation*}
where $i$ is the team, $l \in \{Home\text{ or } Away \}$, $c$ is the country, and $t$ is the season
