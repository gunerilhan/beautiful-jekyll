### Growth and Welfare Implications of Sector-Specific Innovations ###

**[Link to the paper](https://gunerilhan.github.io/img/Guner-revised-March-2019.pdf)**

I examine the optimal government subsidy of R&D activities when sectors are heterogeneous. To this end, I build an endogenous growth model where R&D drives macroeconomic growth and firm dynamics in two sectors with different characteristics: consumption-goods sector and investment-goods sector. I highlight how various externalities in the innovation process affect the allocation of innovative resources across industries. I calibrate the model to U.S. data and study the quantitative properties of the model. By explicitly examining the transition path after the change in subsidy, I highlight the tradeoff between the consumption level in the short run and the long-run growth. I find that the optimal combination of the subsidy rates as a fraction of firm R&D expenditures is 83 percent in consumption sector and 88 percent in investment sector. By moving from the baseline subsidy rates (10 percent in both sectors), the society can achieve 21 percent welfare gain in consumption equivalent terms. The annual GDP growth rate increases from 1.6 percent to 3.3 percent by this change in subsidy. I also analyze the optimal combination of R&D subsidies when the government budget is limited.

This paper analyzes the gross worker flows over the life cycle. We first document the life-cycle patterns of flows across different labor market states (employment, unemployment, and not in the labor force) as well as job-to-job transitions in the US. Next, we build a model of the aggregate labor market that incorporates the life cycle of workers, consumption-saving decisions, and labor market frictions. Finally, we estimate the model with the US data, and use the estimated model to investigate the effect of taxes and transfers on aggregate labor market outcomes, such as unemployment rate and the labor-force participation rate, through the lens of gross labor market flows.

This paper asks whether participation in elite international football tournaments help teams to perform better in their domestic tournaments. We create a novel dataset by combining end of the season league tables with match level data on betting odds and match scores. Using a regression discontinuity design on top 5 European football leagues, we find that participation in highly selective UEFA Champions League (UCL) generates large performance gains to participating teams. More precisely, participation in the UCL improves i) goal differences (goals scored minus goals conceded) by approximately 0.3 goals per game and ii) probability margin (probability of winning minus probability of losing) by approximately 10 percentage points. By ruling out other potential channels, we argue that our results suggest the importance of peer effects in sports.
