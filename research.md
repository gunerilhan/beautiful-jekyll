### Growth and Welfare Implications of Sector-Specific Innovations ###

**[Link to the paper](https://gunerilhan.github.io/img/Guner-revised-March-2019.pdf)**

I examine the optimal government subsidy of R&D activities when sectors are heterogeneous. To this end, I build an endogenous growth model where R&D drives macroeconomic growth and firm dynamics in two sectors with different characteristics: consumption-goods sector and investment-goods sector. I highlight how various externalities in the innovation process affect the allocation of innovative resources across industries. I calibrate the model to U.S. data and study the quantitative properties of the model. By explicitly examining the transition path after the change in subsidy, I highlight the tradeoff between the consumption level in the short run and the long-run growth. I find that the optimal combination of the subsidy rates as a fraction of firm R&D expenditures is 83 percent in consumption sector and 88 percent in investment sector. By moving from the baseline subsidy rates (10 percent in both sectors), the society can achieve 21 percent welfare gain in consumption equivalent terms. The annual GDP growth rate increases from 1.6 percent to 3.3 percent by this change in subsidy. I also analyze the optimal combination of R&D subsidies when the government budget is limited.

### Worker Flows over the Life Cycle ###

This paper analyzes the gross worker flows over the life cycle. Using Current Population Survey data, we first document the life-cycle patterns of flows across different labor market states (employment, unemployment, and not in the labor force) as well as job-to-job transitions in the US. We build a model of the aggregate labor market that incorporates the life cycle of workers, consumption-saving decisions, and labor market frictions. We estimate the model with the US data, and use the estimated model to investigate the effect of taxes and transfers on aggregate labor market outcomes, such as unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate, through the lens of gross labor market flows.

### Inequality in Sport: Money Brings Success

#### (joint with [Mehdi Hamidi Sahneh](https://www.kent.ac.uk/economics/staff/profiles/mehdi-hamidi-sahneh.html))

We exploit bookmaker's odds to propose a novel measure of competitiveness in sport. We then present two stylized facts: (1) using different measures, we find a decreasing level of competitiveness in the European football (soccer) within 'big five' leagues over the last two decades; (2) Concurrently, economic inequality has increased between clubs in these countries. This strongly suggests that rising income inequality is an important factor in determining the competitiveness level. To establish a causal link, we use a regression discontinuity design to examine the effects of participation in UEFA Champions League (UCL), a prestigious club competition with substantial financial benefits, on the subsequent performance of the teams. We find that participation in UCL improves the probability of winning a game by about 8 percentage points and the within game goal difference by about 0.3 goals.
